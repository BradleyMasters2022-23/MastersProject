  content: "<br>As most confirmed cases have been seen in and around the city of
    Alexandria, we have decided to refer to the cause of these anomalies as the \u201CAlexandrine
    distortion.\u201D However, a case study of a pair of twins in Rhine who appear
    to be aging at different rates [1] suggest that its influence is expanding, and
    rapidly. I have written to Dr. Vaughn to request more information, but so far,
    none has been forthcoming. <br>"
