    the same hour or day multiple times, the affected individual experiences an event
    or conversation which they have already experienced once before. Can be difficult
    to tell apart from natural tricks of the mind. <br>3. Rapid aging \u2013 a person
    goes to sleep at 20 and wakes up at 50. Not all cases are so dramatic or so quick.
    As noted above, a child in Rhine appears to be aging at approximately one-third
    the rate of her identical twin.</indent><br>"
