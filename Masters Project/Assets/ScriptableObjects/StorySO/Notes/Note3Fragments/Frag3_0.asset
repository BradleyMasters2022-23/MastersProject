  content: "Log 1\r\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone else will ever see this, but the
    longer I spend in here the less real I feel, so I have to start writing stuff
    down.\r\n\r\nMy name is Isaac. I\u2019m 14 years old and I\u2019m trapped here.
    I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been here. It can\u2019t have been that
    long because I haven\u2019t needed to eat or sleep. But it feels like it\u2019s
    been years. \r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t seen anyone else. There are these squat little
    robots hovering all over the place but I\u2019ve been trying to stay out of their
    line of sight. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re reading this, please try to find me. I
    want to go home. \r\n"
