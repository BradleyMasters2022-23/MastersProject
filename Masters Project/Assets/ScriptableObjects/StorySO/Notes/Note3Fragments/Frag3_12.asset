    in the center. The whole room glowed purple. I got this really bad feeling. Like
    it shouldn\u2019t exist. Like I should\u2026 stop it. Destroy it. Something should
    be happening and that room is stopping it. I don\u2019t know. It almost\u2026
    doesn\u2019t feel like my own thoughts. I don\u2019t know if I should listen
    or not. \r"
