  content: "Log 6\nI heard a voice. Just the one. I thought at first it was Oliver,
    but Oli doesn\u2019t sound like that. And I\u2019ve never heard him talk to himself
    like that, either. I couldn\u2019t make out the words, and I couldn\u2019t find
    whoever it was when I went looking. Just more robots. I really need a way to
    deal with them. If I could even just destroy one of them, maybe I could steal
    its gun\u2026?\r\n"
