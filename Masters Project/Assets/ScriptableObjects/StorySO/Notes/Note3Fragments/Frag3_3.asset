  content: "Log 7\nI don\u2019t think any of the others are here. I said I hoped
    they weren\u2019t, but now\u2026 I can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed.
    Like, I really am alone in here, aren\u2019t I? \r\n\r\nI think I might have
    figured out a way to destroy one of the robots. There are these jets of flame
    on the floor in some places. Maybe I can trick one of them into following me
    across one. I have to try, anyway. Last time I saw them, one totally charred
    the sleeve of my hoodie. I don\u2019t think I can survive too many more encounters
    without a weapon. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll call it Operation Fried Circuits. Get it?\r"
