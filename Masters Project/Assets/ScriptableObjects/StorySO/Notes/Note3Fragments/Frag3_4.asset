  content: "Log 9\n\u2026 I think I died. \r\n\r\nIt sounds stupid. But one of the
    robots finally caught me, right in the chest. It went all the way through. No
    way you can survive that, right? But\u2026 I woke up back here. No scar or anything.
    I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m looping or if it\u2019s deja vu or something else,
    but I guess it makes a twisted kind of sense. \r\n\r\nAt least I can try Operation
    Fried Circuits again. As many times as it takes. \r\n"
