    I hope that was actually worth it. The blaster seems like it\u2019s in okay shape,
    but I have no idea what the mechanisms that made it work actually were. \r\n\r\nI
    bet Penny would know. That\u2019s my sister. She\u2019s really good at this kind
    of stuff, even though she never really tries all that hard at school. \r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t even know how long it\u2019s been for her. I wonder if she ever found
    a reason to apply herself. I always told her I thought she could do something
    really cool if she tried.\r"
