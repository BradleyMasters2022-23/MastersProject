    I wish I\u2019d tracked how many times I\u2019ve died. There were definitely
    more than I bothered to write down. The longer I\u2019m in this place, the hazier
    my memory of it gets. \r\n\r\nI remember everything from before really well,
    though. I really hope that doesn\u2019t go too. \r\n\r\nAt least now I know how
    to work the robot blasters. Sorta. Gotta take the wins I can get.\r"
