  content: "Travel Log: Day 1: Log Code 00001\r\nIn relation: Trailblazer journey
    to NE-Alpha\r\nAuthor: Captain Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nThe Trailblazer\u2019s journey
    began today. All went according to plan; no hiccups occurred during the departure
    of the vessel. Systems have been fully checked and rations  carefully measured.
    This was a monumental day for humanity, a day where we finally began preparations
    to allow this ruined planet to heal in our absence. Today we leave this scarred,
    tainted Earth for new horizons,  carrying the hope of the people in our cargo.
    The aim of this voyage is to seek another planet which can support humanity while
    Earth heals. Our destination: a planet identified by Mr. Adams as Nuarthia. (This
    name seemed somewhat superfluous to me, so I consulted the real scientists \u2013
    its official name is \u201CNE-Alpha.\u201D) Regardless, I await the adventure
    ahead, and will shortly be making my first announcement to the brave people aboard
    the vessel. I have faith that Mr Adams\u2019 plan to salvage the last of humanity
    will come to fruition. End log."
