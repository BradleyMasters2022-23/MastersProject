  content: "Day 120. Log Code 00120.\nSubject: Trailblazer journey to NE-Alpha\r\nAuthor:
    Captain Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nIt has been exactly four months since our departure
    from Earth. Resources and systems are being depleted and replenished on schedule.
    The vessel\u2019s greenhouses have proven effective at growing new crops and
    generating enough food for the passengers to eat. Mr. Adams was correct that
    this vessel could conceivably sustain the people on its own if necessary, but
    he has assured me that he does truly intend to build a real civilization when
    we land. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I trust him, though \u2013 the ship is
    headed towards NE-Alpha regardless. I have proof that our mission has not been
    stopped or impeded by the ship\u2019s secure standing, so once again I have no
    concerns to report. End log."
