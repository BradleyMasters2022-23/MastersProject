  content: "Travel Log: Day 120: Log Code 00120\r\nIn relation: Trailblazer journey
    to NE-Alpha\r\nAuthor: Captain Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nIt has been exactly four
    months since our departure from Earth. Resources and systems are being depleted
    and replenished on schedule. Dr. Chang assures me that the vessel\u2019s greenhouses
    are proving effective at growing new crops and generating enough food for the
    passengers to eat. The soil was specially formulated to mimic the soil of NE-A,
    so we should be able to begin producing food quickly once we arrive. Still, using
    something as fickle as a greenhouse instead of using the hull space to store
    more nonperishables puts me ill at ease. End log.\r\n"
