  content: "Year 7, Day 119. Log Code 02675.\nSubject: Trailblazer journey to NE-Alpha\r\nAuthor:
    Captain Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nThe crew had a close call today. The passengers
    have become increasingly frustrated with the length of our journey. It seems
    that some were under the impression that we would arrive within six years. It
    has now been more than seven. In their anger, one passenger attempted to add
    an additional power source to the engines, which caused a massive explosion.
    The blast broke through the ship\u2019s hull, sucking all passengers involved
    and a good amount of resources and equipment into space. By my count the incident
    cost us seven lives before we managed to repair the damage and stabilize the
    vessel. This will certainly cause a setback, but we should remain largely on
    schedule. Mr. Adams promised to address the passengers once the situation has
    been fully secured. I can only hope his message doesn\u2019t spark more rebellion.
    End log."
