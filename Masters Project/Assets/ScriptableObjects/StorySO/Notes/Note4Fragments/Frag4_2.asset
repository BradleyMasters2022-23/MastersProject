  content: "Travel Log: Year 2 Day 120: Log Code 00850\r\nIn relation: Trailblazer
    journey to NE-Alpha\r\nAuthor: Captain Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nThe crew had a close
    call today. The passengers are becoming restless. The journey has been long and
    there are still years stretching out before us. In their anger, one passenger
    attempted to add an additional power source to the engines, which caused a massive
    explosion. The blast broke through the ship\u2019s hull, sucking all passengers
    involved and a good amount of resources and equipment into space. By my count
    the incident cost us seven lives before we managed to repair the damage and stabilize
    the vessel. This will certainly cause a setback, but we should remain largely
    on schedule. Mr. Adams promised to address the passengers once the situation
    has been fully secured. I can only hope his message doesn\u2019t spark further
    rebellion. End log.\r\n"
