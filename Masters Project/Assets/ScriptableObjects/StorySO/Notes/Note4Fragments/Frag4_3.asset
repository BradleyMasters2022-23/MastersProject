  content: "Year 10, Day 1. Log Code 03652.\nSubject: Trailblazer journey to NE-Alpha\r\nAuthor:
    Captain Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nTen years have passed since the Trailblazer\u2019s
    initial launch. Despite us moving at a faster than predicted speed, we have not
    yet reached our destination. I fear that with the length of the voyage, my friends
    and family back home may have lost hope, as I am beginning to. With no secure
    way to make contact with Earth, we cannot apprise them of our situation. The
    passengers have begun to grow weary, worrying that the vessel won\u2019t be able
    to sustain them much longer. If it suffers any more damage, they may be right.
    To make matters worse, I have not heard from Mr. Adams directly in 7 months.
    He has been in communication with messages for the passengers, but we have not
    spoken directly since the last incident, during which \u2013 on Mr. Adams\u2019
    own orders \u2013 we were forced to execute another three passengers for attempting
    to sabotage the food supply. Since then, it\u2019s been radio silence. I have
    tried to visit his office multiple times, but to no avail. That\u2019s why I
    plan on sneaking in, tonight\u2026against my better judgment. End log."
