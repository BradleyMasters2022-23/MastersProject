    In relation: Search for Mr Adams

    Author:
    Jeramiah Rogers


    I do not suspect anyone else will read this, but I will
    be keeping a personal log of my findings as I search for the whereabouts of Mr.
    Adams. It has now been many months since he was seen directly. He cannot be dead,
    as I have received orders from him, or at least someone posing as him. In clear
    violation of my orders, I snuck into his quarters, where I discovered his personal
    computer. It was locked by a passcode, but I was able to guess it based on what
    keys on the number pad had been worn down. Its most recent activity was a series
    of heavily encrypted logs between Mr. Adams and Earth support. I am not skilled
    enough with a computer to decode them, but I am hopeful that one of the scientists
    will be able to help me. I still have not found Mr. Adams, but have not given
    up the search. I will update this log as I learn more. End log.
