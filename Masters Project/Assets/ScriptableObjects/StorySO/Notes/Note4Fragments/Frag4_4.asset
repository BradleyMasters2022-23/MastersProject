  content: "Personal Log. Log Code 00001.\nSubject: Mr. Adams\r\nAuthor: Captain
    Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nIf you have found this log, then it\u2019s already too late
    for me. But I will be keeping a personal log of my findings as I search for the
    whereabouts of Mr. Adams. It has now been many months since he was seen directly.
    He cannot be dead, as I have received orders from him, or at least someone posing
    as him. In clear violation of a direct order, I snuck into the restricted cargo
    bay, where I discovered a secret passage hidden behind his wall. It was locked
    by a passcode, but I was able to guess based on which keys had been worn down.
    \u201CK-H-A-N\u201D. Inside, I found a set of stairs leading down to some kind
    of stasis chamber. There were several pods inside, each containing\u2026 a person.
    Only seven were named; the others all unlabeled and clustered together. The names
    were as follows:\n\r\nDimitri Calvin\r\nJames Chang\r\nAi Zhao\r\nGrant Mendel\r\nNiamh
    Calloway\r\nJean Blanchet\r\nAnanya Kaur \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t recognize these
    names at all, and will be doing research into them later on. I didn\u2019t even
    know it was possible for people to be frozen like this. I cannot help but wonder
    why Mr. Adams didn\u2019t use this technology on the rest of the crew and passengers,
    and instead left us to feel every minute in space scrape away at our being. I
    still have not found Mr. Adams, but have not given up the search. I will update
    this log as I learn more. End log.\r\n"
