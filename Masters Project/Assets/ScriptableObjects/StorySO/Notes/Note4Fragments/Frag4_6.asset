  content: "Personal Log. Log Code 00001.\nSubject: Mr. Adams\r\nAuthor: Captain
    Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nIt\u2019s been a month since my previous personal log. Tonight,
    I attempted another break-in. To repeat: if you are reading this log, I am dead,
    and it is essential that this information reach the people. \r\n\r\nI did some
    research into the seven names listed on the stasis pods, and found absolutely
    nothing. Their names have been completely struck from Mr. Adams\u2019 public
    employment records\u2026 I had to dig a little further into the records beyond
    my clearance level, stored on Mr. Adams\u2019 personal computer. This is where
    I finally found them all, under the label \u201CSpecialists\u201D. They appear
    to be lead researchers for something called the Eden Project, which on its own
    already makes me nervous. Each of these individuals appears to have their own
    specialty in the project, relating to studying the sciences of unknown life and
    planets. They must be meant to help analyze whatever we find on NE-Alpha, but
    if that\u2019s the case, why keep their identities secret? Before I could find
    out, I heard a noise from the door, and hid. I had to leave quickly after that
    in order to avoid being caught. But I am not finished here \u2013 I swear it.
    End log.\r\n"
