  content: "Personal Log: Log Code 00002\r\nIn relation: Search for Mr Adams\r\nAuthor:
    Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nIt\u2019s been a month since my previous personal log. I
    have enlisted the help of Dr. Ananya Kaur in decrypting the communications I
    found. She appears troubled these past few days, but tells me she has not yet
    finished with all the logs. Still, whatever she found that has her so worried
    is worrying me, as well. Mr. Adams has not turned up yet.\r\n"
