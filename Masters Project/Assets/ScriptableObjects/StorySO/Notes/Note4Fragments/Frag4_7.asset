  content: "Personal Log: Log Code 00003\r\nIn relation: Search for Mr Adams\r\nAuthor:
    Jeramiah Rogers\r\nI have discovered the truth behind Mr. Adams\u2019 disappearance.
    Dr. Kaur has finished decrypting the communications. NE-Alpha is uninhabitable.
    Unsafe for human life. The logs were cryptic about the reasoning, but suffice
    to say that we were lied to. And now it\u2019s too late to turn back. We don\u2019t
    have enough supplies. Which brings me to my next point: Mr. Adams is no longer
    on the ship. The food that disappeared in the altercation mentioned in Travel
    Log 03652 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t stolen by those poor passengers we murdered at
    all. It was stolen by Mr. Adams for his escape journey.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know
    what the right thing to do is. We cannot turn back; there aren\u2019t enough
    supplies or fuel. Should I tell the passengers? Should I conceal this information?
    It will get out eventually. But hiding it for now could prevent mutiny on the
    ship. Perhaps once things have settled on the planet\u2019s surface they will
    be better equipped to hear the news. Perhaps by then our rescue will already
    be on its way. \u2026 I want to believe that.\r\n"
