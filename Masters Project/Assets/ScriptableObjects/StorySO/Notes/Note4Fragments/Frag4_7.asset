  content: "Personal Log. Log Code 00003\r.\nSubject: Mr Adams\r\nAuthor: Captain
    Jeramiah Rogers\r\n\nOnce more: if you are hearing this log, I am dead, and this
    information must make it to as many people as possible, immediately. \r\n\r\nThis
    will more than likely be my final log. \r\n\r\nI have discovered the truth behind
    Mr. Adams\u2019 disappearance. In sifting through the files on his computer I
    found a series of logs between Mr. Adams and ground control back home on Earth.
    NE-Alpha is uninhabitable. Unsafe for human life. The logs were cryptic about
    the reasoning, but suffice to say that we were lied to. And now it\u2019s too
    late to turn back. We don\u2019t have enough supplies. Which brings me to my
    next point: Mr. Adams is no longer on the ship. The food that disappeared in
    the altercation mentioned in Travel Log 03652 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t stolen by
    those poor passengers we murdered at all. It was stolen by Mr. Adams for his
    escape journey. I need to let everyone know. I\u2013\r\n\r\n<b>BANG</b>\r\n\r\n<i>You
    there! Freeze!</i>\r\n"
