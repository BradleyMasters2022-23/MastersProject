  content: "Battle Log #001\r\nAuthor: Dimitri Calvin.\r\nI cannot imagine that anyone
    will ever read this, but it is my nature to document my findings, even when documentation
    is futile. \r\n\r\nEveryone but myself, Ai, and Grant is dead. The robots that
    were meant to protect us have been hijacked by some unidentified force. First,
    the crystals began to form over their circuits. Grant managed to extract a sample
    before the attacks began, but its molecular structure is like nothing he\u2019s
    ever seen before. Ai thinks it looks more biological than geological. Like the
    shell of a cicada. Like it was once part of something alive.\r\n\r\nI think whatever
    took over Ananya\u2019s robots is starting to take me over, too. I can\u2019t
    see it yet. But I feel it under my skin. \r\n"
