  content: "Battle Log #002\r\nAuthor: Dimitri Calvin.\r\nGrant is hurt. Against
    my advice, he ventured out of the barricaded laboratory in an attempt to retrieve
    another sample of the crystalline substance. The robots nearly killed him. Ai
    and I successfully bandaged his wounds, but I don\u2019t know whether he will
    survive. \r\n\r\nIt is getting harder and harder to care about anyone. Ai found
    one of Niamh\u2019s annotated star charts and started weeping. Before, I know
    I would have tried to comfort her, as Grant did. Instead I found myself annoyed
    by it. Even now, although I know that was an inappropriate reaction, I don\u2019t
    feel horrified like I know I should. \r\n\r\nThe crystals are beginning to grow
    over my legs. Should I quarantine myself to spare the others? What will happen
    if I don\u2019t?\r"
