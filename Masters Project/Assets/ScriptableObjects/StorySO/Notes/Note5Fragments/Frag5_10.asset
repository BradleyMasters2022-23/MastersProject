  content: "Final Stand Log #1/100\r\nThe true threat is here. I can see it making
    its way through the laboratory like a whirlwind. It is dangerous. The girl is
    dangerous. She cannot be allowed to proceed. At any cost. At any cost. At any
    cost. \r\n\r\nThis threat, too, has some amount of control over the flow of time
    in this place. It doesn\u2019t matter. I am stronger. My control of time is stronger.
    My <i>mind</i> is stronger. If she stops time, I will simply start it again.
    It will take a concerted effort \u2013 probably only localized to a few small
    pockets. But it will be enough. \r"
