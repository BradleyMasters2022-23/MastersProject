  content: "Final Stand Log #009\r\nAuthor: Dimitri Calvin.\r\nI\u2019ve managed
    to stall the progression of the crystals, for now. It\u2019s a delicate process,
    utilizing the distortion\u2019s own power. What else can I do with this power\u2026?
    The possibilities are endless. And I will need it, sooner than later. The crystals
    speak to me. They tell me of an encroaching threat. Fine. Let them come. I will
    be ready.\r\n\r\nFirst, I must dispose of what remains of the team. I have no
    need for either of them anymore. I have no need for anyone at all. \r"
