  content: "Final Stand Log #023\r\nI heard the crying of a child today. It is strange.
    There should be no one here but me. But I could not find the child when I went
    searching. \r\n\r\nIs this the threat the crystals warn of\u2026? But their singing
    is no louder now than it ever is. Surely something would change. Regardless,
    I will operate under the assumption that it is in fact the threat. \r\n\r\nThe
    first laser is complete. It leaves a dangerous plasma-like material behind where
    it lands. I am pleased, but not satisfied. It is not enough yet. Not enough firepower.
    Not enough protection. I must protect it. At any cost.\r"
