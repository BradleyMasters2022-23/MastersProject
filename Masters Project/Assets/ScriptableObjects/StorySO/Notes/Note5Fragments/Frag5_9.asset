  content: "Final Stand Log #032\r\nThe crystallization finally caught up to me,
    in the wake of that boy\u2019s destructiveness. I can no longer move freely.
    But it doesn\u2019t matter. Why did I fight this for so long\u2026? I am more
    powerful than ever. Time flows through me and out to the world. I can contact
    other times, other versions of myself\u2026 I can even borrow their strength.
    \r\n\r\nAs for the boy\u2026 He\u2019s in a worse place now.\r"
