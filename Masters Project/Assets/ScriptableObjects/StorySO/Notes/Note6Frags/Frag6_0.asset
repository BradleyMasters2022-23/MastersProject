  content: "<i>Penny \u2013 </i>\r\n\r\n<i>The actual journal itself is sort of meandering
    so I\u2019ve left out the irrelevant bits. These are my rough translations of
    the bits of her mad ravings he copied down. Take it with a grain of salt. </i>\r\n\r\nSomeone-Disciple[1]
    opens the chasm and offers up the root[2].\r\nSomeone-Hope-Destruction[3] walks
    in shards of light[4]. \r\nThe hordes will not cage Someone-Hope-Destruction.\r\nSomeone-Child-Hidden[5]
    travels[6] where sound cannot reach.\r\nWalk away. Walk away. Walk away.[7]\r\nSomeone-Power-Eternal
    has always been in this place.\r\n\r\n<i>[1] I think this language constructs
    pronouns with a descriptive root and a suffix. I\u2019ve chosen to translate
    it as \u201Csomeone\u201D with the roots exposed for clarity.\r\n[2] \u2018Root\u2019
    = \u2018source\u2019 = \u2018reason.\u2019 \r\n[3] The root here honestly could
    translate as either \u201Conly hope\u201D or \u201Ctotal destruction.\u201D I
    have no clue which. Sorry.\r\n[4] I translated this as \u2018shards of light,\u2019
    but the root is also used to refer to \u2018crystal\u2019 and \u2018travel.\u2019
    Make of that what you will. \r\n[5] The word for \u2018hidden\u2019 is the same
    as the word for \u2018doomed.\u2019 \r\n[6] \u2018Travel\u2019 uses the same
    root as \u201Cshards of light\u201D before. \r\n[7] This repeats like a LOT.\r\n\r\n\u2013
